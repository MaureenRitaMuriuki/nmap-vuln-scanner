Nmap Vulnerability Scanner
A simple vulnerability scanning script built on Kali Linux using Nmap to identify open ports and known vulnerabilities on a target system.

📖 Project Overview
This project automates basic network scanning tasks, combining service detection and vulnerability script scanning (nmap --script vuln) to help identify potential security risks in target machines or networks.

It is designed to:

Perform full TCP scans.

Detect services and their versions.

Run vulnerability detection scripts from Nmap's NSE library.

Output the results into an organized report format.

🛠 Technologies Used
